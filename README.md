# ODIE -- The Out Door Intelligent Explorer

ODIE is a robot intended as a research vehicle into intelligent
machines.  [ODIE's Bigraphy](http://wrcooke.net/robots/odie/odie.html)
will tell you his story.  Only the technical aspects of the project are
to be found here.

One guiding principal of the project is that intelligence is based largely
on context.  Context means information.  So sensors play a key role.
As currently being implemented, ODIE has a variety of simple sensors and
more and better sensors will be a main focus in the future.

Currently, ODIE has solar panels to charge his battery as well as provide
information on where the "food" (bright light) can be found.  He also has
a series of photo-resistors to better detect light and dark.  There are
thermistors to detect temperature.  The photoresistors, thermistors, as
well as a series of contact switches are arranged around ODIE's body to
give directional information.

ODIE can detect his own hunger (state of battery charge) and he can tell
when he is eating.  He has motors that power two wheels and he can detect
how much power he is putting into those motors.  He also has wheel
encoders on the other two wheels.  The intent of the wheel encoders is
unlike most robots with wheel encoders;  ODIE won't count distance.
Humans don't normally count how far they walk.  Other animals almost
certainly don't.  But the wheel encoders tell ODIE how fast he is
moving and in which direction.  That is something our bodies tell us
through normal feedback.

ODIE will also have rain/water detectors.  He needs to be smart enough
to come in out of the rain.  He may also end up with some sort of
"beacon detector" to recognize his home.  These two items aren't yet
finalized.
